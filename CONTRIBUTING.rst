Contributing
============

Troposphere and CloudFormation open up many possibilities, and we're open to any
contributions that expand the flexibility of this project within its overall mission.

To contribute, you'll need Python 3.5 and a virtual environment with our requirements
installed.

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    mkvirtualenv -p python3.5 aws-web-stacks
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Check Code Formatting
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    make check

Compile JSON Templates
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    make

The templates will be saved to the ``content/`` directory.

Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews.**

* Please rebase your branch against the current ``develop`` branch
* Please ensure ``make check`` and ``make`` (see above) succeed before submitting a PR
* Make reference to possible `issues <https://github.com/caktus/aws-web-stacks/issues>`_ on PR comment

Submitting bug reports
----------------------

* Please include the exact filename of the template used
* Please include any and all error messages generated by AWS

Release Process
---------------

* Merge any PRs targeted for the release into the ``develop`` branch
* Write release notes in the `changelog <https://github.com/caktus/aws-web-stacks/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst>`_
  including:

  * links to PRs as appropriate
  * credit for outside contributors
  * a link (at the bottom of the file) to the listing page in the ``aws-web-stacks`` bucket

* Edit the version number in `version.txt <https://github.com/caktus/aws-web-stacks/blob/develop/version.txt>`_
  and push that to the ``develop`` branch
* Create, review, and merge a PR from the ``develop`` branch to the ``master`` branch, titled with
  the release number e.g., "Release 1.2.0"
* After merging, Circle CI will build the templates and upload them to S3. The current, stable (unversioned)
  releases will be overwritten, and a copy of the release will be archived to a folder named for the version
  in the S3 bucket. **For this reason, it is very important that no commits with new code be made to master
  before incrementing the version number, or the JSON for the previous release may be overwritten.**
* Tag the release in Git and push it to GitHub, e.g.::

    git checkout master
    git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "v1.2.0"
    git push origin v1.2.0

* Navigate to the Releases tab in GitHub and edit the release for the tag just pushed, including a copy of
  the release notes
